    <h1>AAA Testing Tutorial</h1>
    <h3 class="lead">Introduction to AAA Patterns for Testing</h3>
    <p>
        So, we've successfully finished coding. We finally have, for all intents and purposes, a fully functional program.
        Now what? An inexperienced programmer would call it a done day, and move on to another project. This may be fine
        with a smaller project, but this would eventually cause problems later on in development, especially for complex
        business projects with many requirements. Now, pose this question to an experienced programmer who has been in
        the field for many years, and they would all say without hesitation that testing is the next step. Picture this,
        you send this project to friends and family to show them your hard work. Within a few hours of sending it, you
        get a call from your younger brother saying that the program broke after using it for an hour. This is exactly
        why testing is so important; <i>users of the program will most likely break the program extremely quickly</i>.
        Through testing, we stress test the program so that when it is finally sent to the public, the programs' integrity
        remains strong.

    <h3 class="lead">Explanation</h3>
    <p>
        AAA stands for arrange, act, and assert. <i>Arranging</i> a test should set up the test. So, while testing a
        calculator, for example, arranging the test should entail setting up a simple addition between numbers. <i>Acting</i>
        is exactly what it says, we act on the arranged equation. Lastly, <i>assertion</i> of a test entails a response
        to the action which just occurred. So, in this test case, we would check that the addition of the two numbers
        comes to the correct value. Below will be an actual AAA testing example.

    <h3 class="lead">External Data</h3>
    <p>
        In a corporate environment, however, the style of testing shown above will not be sufficient. As I said earlier,
        When software is sent to the public, they will most likely find ways to break the program that the developers
        had not even thought of. In other words, <i>the volume</i> of data must be substantially larger to cover fringe
        cases. However, it is extremely inefficient to input thousands of tests by hand like the one shown above. To bypass
        this issue, a programmer can introduce external data to test functionality of a program. Imagine we are testing
        an addition function again. Instead of explicitly telling the computer what values to add and what they should
        equal, we can pass an Excel spreadsheet, or a CSV (Comma Seperated Values) file into the program and have it
        check for us. It is <i>much</i> easier to generate values in an Excel spreadsheet than it is to manually
        put data into a test.
